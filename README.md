# Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System-Using-OpenCV
Maintaining the attendance record during online sessions is a big challenge. The conventional method of calling out roll number of each student and marking their attendance is a time-consuming task and there is always a chanced of proxy attendance. With the advent of the era of big data in the world and the commercial value of face recognition technology, the prospects for face recognition technology are very bright and have great market demand. This project aims to design a face recognition attendance system based on real-time video processing. Experimental data shows that compared with the traditional check-in method, the rate of skipping classes has greatly reduced the phenomenon of students leaving early and skipping classes in the face recognition attendance system. The face recognition attendance system with real-time video processing can quickly complete the lecturerâ€™s tasks of attendance marking, get rid of the complex naming phenomenon, greatly improve the efficiency of class, and play an important role in guiding the development of the time and attendance system.
